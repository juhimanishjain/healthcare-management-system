## Project Overview

The portal supports essential patient information, medical records, appointment tracking, and prescription viewing, all within a clean and user-friendly interface.

## Why This Matters

The importance of digitized patient information management stems from the need for:

- **Efficiency & Accessibility:**  
  Eliminating manual paperwork streamlines the process of storing, updating, and accessing patient records.

- **Real-Time Updates:**  
  Medical histories and treatment records can be updated instantly, ensuring accuracy across providers.

- **Patient Safety:**  
  Digital systems reduce the likelihood of human error, such as medication mix-ups or missing information.

- **Telehealth Support:**  
  Enables remote access to medical records and consultations, increasing care accessibility regardless of location.
