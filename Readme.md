The importance of digitalized patient information management comes from efficiency and accessibility, as by eliminating manual paperwork the accessibility to patient records becomes easier and more efficient. In addition to this, with digital systems patient records can be updated in real time. There is also increased patient safety as there would be less room for error and updates can be easily made if needed.
